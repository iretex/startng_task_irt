        Thesis: Simulation of Vehicle Rollover – with focus on SUVs due to their high centre of gravity which implies an
        increased propensity for rollover and their recent surge in popularity. The research aim is to improve on existing
        vehicle models by optimizing the vehicle characteristics followed by a dynamic simulation to observe the model’s
        performance – Fishhook Maneuver Test is adopted for this study and further iteration was done to determine the most
        optimal characteristics that minimize the models’ susceptibility to roll over before such a model will be sent to
        production. The simulation platform used was Matlab/Simulink™
